I got a data-set of cars from Kaggle.

The data-set can be downloaded from here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset/data). 

To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine Size, HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more. 

So in this tutorial, we will explore the data and make it ready for modeling.
